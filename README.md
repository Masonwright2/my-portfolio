# Mason Wright — Developer Portfolio

This repository contains my personal developer portfolio, serving as a central hub for my software projects across frontend development, full-stack systems, applied problem solving, and engineering simulations.

The portfolio is designed to present projects intentionally — distinguishing between live deployed applications and local-run engineering systems — while emphasizing clean architecture, thoughtful tradeoffs, and real-world development workflows.

## Project Types Represented

### Live Deployed Applications
Projects deployed via Vercel or cloud platforms to demonstrate:
- Production-style workflows
- CI/CD via GitHub integration
- Real user-facing interfaces
- Iterative improvement over time

### Engineering & Simulation Projects
Some projects are intentionally **run locally** to preserve:
- Deterministic behavior
- System-level control
- Modular architecture
- Debuggable simulation state

These projects are showcased through source code, documentation, and architectural explanation rather than hosted demos.

---

## Design Philosophy

This portfolio prioritizes:
- Clear intent over visual noise
- Structure over cleverness
- Engineering tradeoffs over gimmicks
- Maintainability over one-off demos

Each project is presented honestly, with its constraints made explicit.

---

## Running Locally

To run the portfolio locally:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project folder in VS Code
3. Open `index.html` directly in a browser  
   **or**
4. Use the VS Code **Live Server** extension

No build step is required.

## Project Status

This portfolio is actively maintained and updated as new projects are completed and existing systems are refined.
